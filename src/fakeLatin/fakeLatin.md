## Instructions

Write a function that takes in a string and returns a string. The first letter of each word in that string should be moved to the end and then `"ay"` should be added to the end of each word.

Ensure that if there are capitals, at the beginning of each word, those capitals are made lowercase when moved to the end and the letter after which is now the first letter be capitalized.

For example, the input `Pigs can fly` should return `Igspay ancay lyfay`

Ignore any punctuation
