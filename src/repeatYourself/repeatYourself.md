## Instructions

Write a function that takes in 2 parameters. The first is a string value which repeats itself
based on the number of times given in the second parameter.

You can use built in functions or write your own (preferred)

For example,

given the input (first param) `hello` and given the number of times (second param) `3`

it should return `hellohellohello`
