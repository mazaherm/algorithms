## Instructions

Write a function that takes in an array of a string of names
and returns a string that says those names like it.

For example, the input `['Henry']` will return `Henry likes it`.

When array length is 2, return `Henry and Den like it`
When the array length is 3 return `Henry, Dean and Sam like it`
and when the array is more than 3, return only the first 2 names + the string `and [number] others like it` e.g. `Henry, Dean and 6 others like it`
